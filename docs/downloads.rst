- Always check if there are known `bugs
  <https://github.com/mretegan/crispy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+>`_
  for the current version.
- The packages include the latest version of Quanty available at the time of
  the Crispy release. Therefore, if you haven't done so already, **please
  register** on the `Quanty <http://quanty.org/start?do=register>`_ website.
- The macOS application is not signed and you will get an error when you try to
  launch it the first time. You can grant an exception for Crispy by clicking
  the "Open Anyway" button in the General panel of Security & Privacy
  preferences.  You can find more about this in the `official documentation
  <https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US>`_.
- On Windows, some antivirus programs might block the installation of the
  application and even delete the installer from the disk. I assume that this
  is because the installer is not signed. Please rest assured that all releases
  are scanned using multiple antivirus programs on `VirusTotal
  <https://www.virustotal.com>`_. Also please make sure that you first uninstall
  older versions of Crispy before you proceed with the new installation.
- You can download older versions from the `releases
  <https://github.com/mretegan/crispy/releases>`_ page on GitHub.
